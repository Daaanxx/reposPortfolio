# DESCRIPTION
The main focus of this project is to create my first portfolio, using technologies I am currently capable of using.
Building this website was an amazing challenge that pushed my coding and designing skill to the next level.
I fell more confident with using CSS & HTML and have better understanding of design rules and responsive web design.
While building this project, I tried to implement a lot of new tricks I picked up along the way such as:
using more than one .css file to store other styles and keep my CSS cleaner (in this case media.css to store mediaqueries), using google fonts and other web pages to further style my website, for example haikei.app.
